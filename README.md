This is the first stable and complete release of Celery for Dynamo. It was meant to work for Dynamo 2.0 and onwards.

Although there is a more organized version of this package, it is not complete as there were experimentations done to adapt in the changing of node size, and it was not successful at the last time of testing.

Use this repository of Celery, re-organize (separating the NodeViewCustomization classes to a different file etc.) and integrate it in the core.

If you have any inquiries regarding this one, please e-mail me at uma.ps.anave.0901@gmail.com. Thanks!
